-- Two packages that need each other without depending on each other.
--
-- A `with` entry is one file, named in `package.lua` against the *other* package:
--
--   with = { session = "with/themes.lua" }
--
-- and it runs only while both packages are active. It goes up when the second of
-- the two arrives and comes down when the first of them leaves.
--
-- The difference from `dependencies` is the whole point. A dependency says "load
-- this first", which means neither package is usable alone, so installing one
-- without the other is a broken install. A `with` entry says "if both are here,
-- wire them up", which means either can be installed, or uninstalled, on its own.
-- `themes` pushes the chosen theme into the session's saved state, and a user with
-- themes but no session wants the switcher to keep working.
--
-- So a `with` entry is not a dependency and does not sort the load order: the file
-- is required at the moment both are up, and by then there is nothing to sort.
-- That is also why it is allowed to reach the other package's internals, which is
-- why it lives in its own directory -- the path is the evidence, and check.lua can
-- tell a `with` file from an ordinary module by where it is.
--
-- The contract is a feature's contract: `enable()` registers, `disable()` undoes it
-- with the same table. Not checkable from here, so the shape is checked instead
-- (check.lua R8) and the symmetry is what `disable_all` relies on.
