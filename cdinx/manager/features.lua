-- A package's features: the parts of it that can be switched off.
--
-- A feature is one file, `features/<key>.lua`, returning `enable()` and
-- `disable()`. `package.lua` names them and gives each a default:
--
--   features = { tab = { default = true, description = "Tab bar" } }
--
-- A feature is a separate file rather than a flag inside one init because that
-- is the only way the cost can be avoided: a feature nobody enabled is never
-- required, so its commands, its keymap and its module state are never built.
-- Loading all of a package to discover which third of it you want is the thing
-- this replaces.
--
-- The contract a feature file honours is the package's own (invariant 7): every
-- registration `enable` makes, `disable` takes back, with the same table. That
-- is not checkable from here — it is the author's promise — so the shape is
-- checked instead (check.lua R8) and the symmetry is what `disable_all` relies
-- on.
