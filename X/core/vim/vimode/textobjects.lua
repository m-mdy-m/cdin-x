-- Vim's text objects: two keys that name a *region* rather than a place.
--
-- This is the half of the report that says `yi"` and `di"` do nothing, and it
-- is missing for a reason that is not obvious from the outside. `d` needs to
-- know what to delete; a motion tells it where the cursor should end up, which
-- is not the same thing. `di"` does not mean "delete to the character after the
-- next quote" — it means "delete the text between these two quotes", a region
-- chosen by a rule of its own that has nothing to do with where the cursor was
-- pointing. So there is no motion that expresses it, and a table of motions
-- cannot grow one.
--
-- An object is therefore a span and nothing else: `find(name, doc, line, col)`
-- answers the half-open range the name covers, or nil when the name does not
-- cover anything here — `di(` outside a bracket, `di"` on a line with one
-- quote. Nil is not an error. It is what vim beeps at, and it is the answer
-- that lets the operator do nothing instead of guessing.
--
-- Like motions, every entry is a function of (document, line, column) and
-- touches no view and no clipboard, so normal mode, an operator and `.` all
-- agree about what `a"` means.

-- ── words ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `iw` is the run of same-class characters around the cursor, whatever class
-- that is: a word on a letter, a run of punctuation on a comma, and the
-- whitespace itself on a space. That is not a simplification, it is vim's
-- rule, and it is why `diw` on a comma removes the comma rather than the whole
-- sentence it sits in.
--
-- `aw` is that run plus one piece of surrounding whitespace. Which piece is
-- decided by whether there is any after — and that is the part worth spelling
-- out, because `aw` at the end of a line takes the *leading* space, and an
-- implementation that only ever looks forward deletes the newline instead.

  -- Punctuation glued to the word belongs to it as far as `aw` is concerned:
  -- `aw` on the `a` of `a, b` takes `a, ` and not `a`. Without this, `daw` on a
  -- comma-separated list leaves the commas behind, which is the complaint that
  -- makes people reach for `x` instead.

  -- to on the last word of a line. An implementation that only ever looks
  -- forward reaches the newline instead and deletes it.

-- ── quotes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- All of them are collected and then paired by *alternation*: the first is an
-- opening quote, the second closes it, the third opens the next pair, and so
-- on. Pairing neighbours instead — "the nearest quote before, and the nearest
-- after" — is wrong the moment a line holds two separate quoted strings, and
-- wrong in the way that is hardest to notice: in `"a" and "b"` with the cursor
-- on the `d` of `and`, adjacency hands back the space between the strings and
-- `di"` deletes ` and `.
--
-- Given the pairing, the choice is then:
--
--   on a quote     an odd-numbered quote opens the pair, an even one closes it
--   inside a pair  that pair
--   otherwise      the next pair forward, else the previous one

-- ── bracket pairs ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Unlike quotes, a bracket pair *encloses*. `di(` means the contents of the
-- innermost pair around the cursor, so this walks back to the nearest unmatched
-- opener and then forward to its partner — and because it starts by looking at
-- the cursor's own column, a cursor sitting on a bracket is treated as being
-- inside it, which is what makes `di(` work when the caret is up against the
-- bracket rather than in the middle of the text.

-- ── tags ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The one object that has to see past the end of the line, and the reason
-- `text.flat` exists. An HTML tag opens on one line and closes forty lines
-- later, so the name is found backwards from the cursor and its partner
-- forwards from there, both in the flattened buffer.
--
-- The name is read from the *innermost* `<` before the cursor, which is the
-- opening tag when the cursor is in the body and the tag itself when it is up
