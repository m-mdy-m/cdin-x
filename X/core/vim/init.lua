-- Vim-style modal editing and the ex command line.
--
-- Vim core owns *only* vim's own vocabulary — motions, operators, the ex-commands
-- for files, the shell escape, the mode pill. Everything that needs another
-- package's behaviour is a `with` entry under `with/`, and everything that is
-- vim's own surface but optional is a feature under `features/`. Both reach vim
-- through the single registry in registry.lua (ex-commands, the Ctrl+W map, the
-- "g" map, single keys, and events).
--
-- Layout:
--   package.lua    the manifest: data only, read in a sandbox
--   init.lua       this file — the one load point
--   registry.lua   the extension points features and with-entries register into
--   commands.lua   vim's own cdin commands
--   keymap.lua     vim's own non-modal key bindings
--   ex/            the ":" command line, split by concern
--   shell/         running shell commands and showing their output
--   vimode/        modal editing: the key reader, motions, text objects,
--                  the operators, mode state, and the status pill
--   menus/         vim's file, shell and build menus
--   plugin-manager/ the "M" key
--   features/      menus.lua, plugin-manager.lua
--   with/          git.lua, search.lua, tab.lua, treeview.lua, window.lua
--   git/ search/ tab/ treeview/ window/
--                  the modules each with-entry owns
--
-- Two ordering rules hold the whole thing together, and both come from where
-- `vim.main` is defined.
--
-- It is defined *here*, in init, rather than in the menus feature. Four things
-- extend it — the plugin-manager feature and the git, search and treeview
-- with-entries — and `menu.extend` asserts the menu exists. Had the definition
-- lived in an optional part, whether an extender worked would have depended on
-- two optional things happening to load in the right order. init always runs
-- first, so `vim.main` is always there.
--
-- And it is guarded rather than required, because the `menu` package is optional.
-- A user with vim and no menus gets every key and no menu, which is the same
-- degradation every menu extender already had.

  -- `if not config.vim_mode_enabled then return false end`, so with the value left
  -- nil the key handler bails on the first keystroke and vim mode is silently off
  -- — which looks exactly like "vim is not loaded" and sends you looking for a key
  -- to turn it on with.
  --
  -- The guard is `== nil`, not `=`, so a user who set it in their
  -- ~/.config/cdin/user/init.lua keeps their value. That file runs before plugins,
