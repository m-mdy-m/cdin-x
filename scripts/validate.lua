-- will look up — `ctrl+`, then `alt+`, then `altgr+`, then `shift+`, then the
-- key's own name — and compares that string for equality, with no
-- normalisation. So a stroke that differs in modifier order, in case, or in
-- where its `+` signs are is not a near miss: it is a string no key press can
-- produce, and the binding carrying it is dead — silently, because a miss in
-- `keymap.on_key_pressed` returns false and says nothing.
--
-- `["ctrl+shift+alt+n"]` sat in treeview's keymap for months being exactly
-- that. So this is checked here, where a typo costs a lint run instead of an
-- afternoon of pressing keys.
--
